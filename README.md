## ⚡ Why RESCUE-MESH?

When natural disasters strike, standard cellular networks are often the first infrastructure to fail. RESCUE-MESH solves this by providing a hyper-local, offline-first mesh network powered by ESP8266 nodes and Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). 

If you can connect to our local WiFi bubble, you can summon an ambulance.

## ✨ Features

<details open>
<summary><b>1. Ground-Zero SOS Form (Offline-First)</b></summary>
Victims can submit SOS signals even without an internet connection. Data is cached locally using IndexedDB and automatically syncs (via Yjs CRDTs) the moment an uplink is established.
</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>2. Autonomous Priority Triage AI</b></summary>
An onboard NLP engine automatically scans emergency text, calculating a 0-100 severity score and assigning priority labels (`CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`) so dispatchers know who needs help first.
</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>3. Command Dispatch Dashboard</b></summary>
A clean, professional, NDRF-grade dispatch center UI. Dispatchers can view a live geospatial map of requests, monitor fleet statistics, and assign units (Ambulances, Fire Teams) with a single click.

> ### 💬 A Message to the Team from Benadic
> 
> *Hey team, we pulled it off! We went from a simple concept to a fully functioning, offline-capable, responsive dispatch platform. The AI triage is working flawlessly, the backend sync is solid, and the UI is looking like a professional military-grade dashboard. Get some rest tonight, because tomorrow we are going to absolutely crush this hackathon presentation. So proud of what we built together! Let's go win this! 🚀*
